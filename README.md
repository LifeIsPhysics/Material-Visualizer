# Material-Visualizer
Library written in modern C++23 to visualize material crystal structure of chemical compounds. 

# Motivation
Scientists often use synthesize chemical compounds in the lab to get materials with certain properties, 
to for example realize physical systems (one/two/three-dimensions sing chains under transverse field) 
and study its underlying physics or create materials that can be used in future hardware technologies 
(Magnetic RAM based on materials with Magnetic Skyrmion Phase). The chemical structure plays a vital 
role in assesing the physical, mechanical and chemical properties of the material, and therefor helps 
scientists to gain intuition about the properties of synthesized materials. Software that visualizes 
the crystal structure of chemical compounds is in that sense very important.

# Usage
```bash
./MaterialVisualizer <data:jsonfile>
```

# Example output
Visualization of CoNb2O6
